AsyncSSH: Asynchronous SSH for Python
=====================================

AsyncSSH is a Python package which provides an asynchronous client and
server implementation of the SSHv2 protocol on top of the Python 3.6+
asyncio framework.

.. code:: python

  import asyncio, asyncssh, sys

  async def run_client():
      async with asyncssh.connect('localhost') as conn:
          result = await conn.run('echo "Hello!"', check=True)
          print(result.stdout, end='')

  try:
      asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(run_client())
  except (OSError, asyncssh.Error) as exc:
      sys.exit('SSH connection failed: ' + str(exc))

Check out the `examples`__ to get started!

Prerequisites
-------------

To use AsyncSSH 2.0 or later, you need the following:

* Python 3.6 or later
* cryptography (PyCA) 3.1 or later

Installation
------------

Install AsyncSSH by running:

  ::

    pip install asyncssh

Optional Extras
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are some optional modules you can install to enable additional
functionality:

* Install bcrypt from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bcrypt
  if you want support for OpenSSH private key encryption.

* Install fido2 from https://pypi.org/project/fido2 if you want support
  for key exchange and authentication with U2F/FIDO2 security keys.

* Install python-pkcs11 from https://pypi.org/project/python-pkcs11 if
  you want support for accessing PIV keys on PKCS#11 security tokens.

* Install gssapi from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gssapi if you
  want support for GSSAPI key exchange and authentication on UNIX.

* Install liboqs from https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs
  if you want support for the OpenSSH post-quantum key exchange
  algorithm sntrup761x25519-sha512\@openssh.com.

* Install libsodium from https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
  and libnacl from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libnacl if you have
  a version of OpenSSL older than 1.1.1b installed and you want
  support for Curve25519 key exchange, Ed25519 keys and certificates,
  or the Chacha20-Poly1305 cipher.

* Install libnettle from http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/
  if you want support for UMAC cryptographic hashes.

* Install pyOpenSSL from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyOpenSSL
  if you want support for X.509 certificate authentication.

* Install pywin32 from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pywin32 if you
  want support for using the Pageant agent or support for GSSAPI
  key exchange and authentication on Windows.

AsyncSSH defines the following optional PyPI extra packages to make it
easy to install any or all of these dependencies:

  | bcrypt
  | fido2
  | gssapi
  | libnacl
  | pkcs11
  | pyOpenSSL
  | pywin32

For example, to install bcrypt, fido2, gssapi, libnacl, pkcs11, and
pyOpenSSL on UNIX, you can run:

  ::

    pip install 'asyncssh[bcrypt,fido2,gssapi,libnacl,pkcs11,pyOpenSSL]'

To install bcrypt, fido2, libnacl, pkcs11, pyOpenSSL, and pywin32 on
Windows, you can run:

  ::

    pip install 'asyncssh[bcrypt,fido2,libnacl,pkcs11,pyOpenSSL,pywin32]'

Note that you will still need to manually install the libsodium library
listed above for libnacl to work correctly and/or libnettle for UMAC
support. Unfortunately, since liboqs, libsodium, and libnettle are not
Python packages, they cannot be directly installed using pip.

Installing the development branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you would like to install the development branch of asyncssh directly
from Github, you can use the following command to do this:

  ::

      pip install git+https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh@develop
