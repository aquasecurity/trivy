Comment: This is the pre-packaged Debian Linux version of the zlib compression
 library.  It was packaged by Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org>
 from sources originally retrieved from ftp.uu.net in the directory
 /pub/archiving/zip/zlib as the file zlib-1.0.4.tar.gz.
 .
 The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz. The deflate
 and zlib specifications were written by Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the
 people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib;
 they are too numerous to cite here.
