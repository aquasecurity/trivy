Test case: Cargo.toml with only [workspace.dependencies] section (no [dependencies]).

This test verifies that the analyzer handles projects where:
- Cargo.toml has [workspace.dependencies] but no [dependencies] section
- Dependencies are still resolved correctly from Cargo.lock

Expected behavior:
- Root package "app" should have RelationshipRoot
- memchr should have RelationshipDirect (resolved from workspace.dependencies)
