Test case: Workspace with version.workspace = true inheritance.

This test verifies that the analyzer correctly handles Cargo workspaces where
member packages inherit version from [workspace.package].

Structure:
- Root Cargo.toml: defines [workspace.package] with version = "2.0.0"
- app/Cargo.toml: member package using version.workspace = true

Expected behavior:
- Virtual workspace root should have RelationshipRoot with no name/version
- myapp should have RelationshipWorkspace with version "2.0.0" (inherited)
- serde should have RelationshipDirect
