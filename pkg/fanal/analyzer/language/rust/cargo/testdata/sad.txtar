Test case: Broken/malformed Cargo.lock file.

This test verifies that the analyzer gracefully handles a corrupted Cargo.lock file.
The file contains only "[" which is invalid TOML.

Expected behavior:
- Return empty AnalysisResult (no error, just empty result)
- Do not crash or panic

-- Cargo.lock --
