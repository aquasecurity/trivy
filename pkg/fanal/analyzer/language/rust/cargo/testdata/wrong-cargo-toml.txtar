Test case: Malformed Cargo.toml with valid Cargo.lock.

This test verifies that the analyzer handles a corrupted Cargo.toml file gracefully.
The Cargo.toml contains only "[" which is invalid TOML, but Cargo.lock is valid.

Expected behavior:
- Fall back to parsing only Cargo.lock
- All packages should have RelationshipUnknown (cannot determine relationships)
- Package information should still be extracted from Cargo.lock
