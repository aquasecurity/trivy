# Pull Request Review Policy

This document outlines the review policy for pull requests in the Trivy project.

## Core Principles

### 1. All Changes Through Pull Requests
All changes to the `main` branch must be made through pull requests. Direct commits to `main` are not allowed.

### 2. Required Approvals
Every pull request requires approval from at least one CODEOWNER before merging.

### 3. Merge Responsibility
- **General Rule**: The pull request author should click the merge button after receiving required approvals
- **Exception**: For urgent fixes (hotfixes), a CODEOWNER may merge the PR directly
- **External Contributors**: Pull requests from external contributors should be merged by a CODEOWNER
