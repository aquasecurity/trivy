## Adding tutorials

You are welcome to create tutorials and showcase them here. Tutorials can be either included in here as full articles, or included as external links under [external community resources][community-resources]. 
Before sending PR, please first create an issue (of kind "Documentation") and describe the suggestion, if it's external link or article, and what category it's under.

Guidelines:

- Focus on a specific use case. Start by clearly describing the use case and when/who it is relevant for.
- Provide an end-to-end set of instructions. Make sure anyone can easily follow.
- Describe the expected outcome after each step. Include examples as much as possible.
