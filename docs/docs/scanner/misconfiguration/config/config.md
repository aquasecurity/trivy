This page describes misconfiguration-specific configuration.

### Enabling a subset of misconfiguration scanners
It's possible to only enable certain misconfiguration scanners if you prefer.
You can do so by passing the `--misconfig-scanners` option.
This flag takes a comma-separated list of configuration scanner types.

```bash
trivy config --misconfig-scanners=terraform,dockerfile .
```

Will only scan for misconfigurations that pertain to Terraform and Dockerfiles.

### Loading custom checks
You can load check files or directories including your custom checks using the `--config-check` flag.
This can be repeated for specifying multiple files or directories.

```bash
trivy config --config-check custom-policy/policy --config-check combine/policy --config-check policy.rego --namespaces user myapp
```

You can load checks bundle as OCI Image from a Container Registry using the `--checks-bundle-repository` flag.

```bash
trivy config --checks-bundle-repository myregistry.local/mychecks --namespaces user myapp
```


### Passing custom data
You can pass directories including your custom data through `--data` option.
This can be repeated for specifying multiple directories.

```bash
cd examples/misconf/custom-data
trivy config --config-check ./my-check --data ./data --namespaces user ./configs
```

For more details, see [Custom Data](./custom/data.md).

### Passing namespaces
By default, Trivy evaluates checks defined in `builtin.*`.
If you want to evaluate custom checks in other packages, you have to specify package prefixes through `--namespaces` option.
This can be repeated for specifying multiple packages.

``` bash
trivy config --config-check ./my-check --namespaces main --namespaces user ./configs
```

### Private Terraform registries
Trivy can download Terraform code from private registries.
To pass credentials you must use the `TF_TOKEN_` environment variables.
You cannot use a `.terraformrc` or `terraform.rc` file, these are not supported by trivy yet.

From the Terraform [docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#environment-variable-credentials):

> Environment variable names should have the prefix TF_TOKEN_ added to the domain name, with periods encoded as underscores.
> For example, the value of a variable named `TF_TOKEN_app_terraform_io` will be used as a bearer authorization token when the CLI makes service requests to the hostname `app.terraform.io`.
>
> You must convert domain names containing non-ASCII characters to their punycode equivalent with an ACE prefix.
> For example, token credentials for `例えば.com` must be set in a variable called `TF_TOKEN_xn--r8j3dr99h_com`.
>
> Hyphens are also valid within host names but usually invalid as variable names and may be encoded as double underscores.
> For example, you can set a token for the domain name café.fr as TF_TOKEN_xn--caf-dma_fr or TF_TOKEN_xn____caf__dma_fr.

If multiple variables evaluate to the same hostname, Trivy will choose the environment variable name where the dashes have not been encoded as double underscores.


### Skipping resources by inline comments

Trivy supports ignoring misconfigured resources by inline comments for Terraform, CloudFormation and Helm configuration files only.

In cases where Trivy can detect comments of a specific format immediately adjacent to resource definitions, it is possible to ignore findings from a single source of resource definition (in contrast to `.trivyignore`, which has a directory-wide scope on all of the files scanned). The format for these comments is `trivy:ignore:<rule>` immediately following the format-specific line-comment [token](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#comments).

The ignore rule must contain one of the possible check IDs that can be found in its metadata: ID, short code or alias. The `id` from the metadata is not case-sensitive, so you can specify, for example, `AVD-AWS-0089` or `avd-aws-0089`.

For example, to ignore a misconfiguration ID `AVD-GCP-0051` in a Terraform HCL file:

```terraform
#trivy:ignore:AVD-GCP-0051
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  name     = var.cluster_name
  location = var.region
}
```

You can add multiple ignores on the same comment line:
```terraform
#trivy:ignore:AVD-GCP-0051 trivy:ignore:AVD-GCP-0053
resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  name     = var.cluster_name
  location = var.region
}
```

You can also specify a long ID, which is formed as follows: `<provider>-<service>-<short-code>`.

As an example, consider the following check metadata:

```yaml
# custom:
  # id: AVD-AWS-0089
  # avd_id: AVD-AWS-0089
  # provider: aws
  # service: s3
  # severity: LOW
  # short_code: enable-logging
```

Long ID would look like the following: `aws-s3-enable-logging`.

Example for CloudFromation:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Resources:
#trivy:ignore:*
  S3Bucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: test-bucket
```

!!!note
Ignore rules for Helm files should be placed before the YAML object, since only it contains the location data needed for ignoring.

Example for Helm:
```yaml
      serviceAccountName: "testchart.serviceAccountName"
      containers:
        # trivy:ignore:KSV018
        - name: "testchart"
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 1000
            runAsGroup: 3000
          image: "your-repository/your-image:your-tag"
          imagePullPolicy: "Always"

          
#### Expiration Date

You can specify the expiration date of the ignore rule in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. This is a useful feature when you want to make sure that an ignored issue is not forgotten and worth revisiting in the future. For example:
```tf
#trivy:ignore:aws-s3-enable-logging:exp:2024-03-10
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "test"
}
```

The `aws-s3-enable-logging` check will be ignored until `2024-03-10` until the ignore rule expires.

#### Ignoring by attributes

You can ignore a resource by its attribute value. This is useful when using the `for-each` meta-argument. For example:

```tf
locals {
  ports = ["3306", "5432"]
}

#trivy:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr[from_port=3306]
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "example" {
  for_each                 = toset(local.ports)
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port                = each.key
  to_port                  = each.key
  protocol                 = "TCP"
  cidr_blocks              = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.example.id
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.example.id
}
```

The `aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr` check will be ignored only for the `aws_security_group_rule` resource with port number `5432`. It is important to note that the ignore rule should not enclose the attribute value in quotes, despite the fact that the port is represented as a string.

If you want to ignore multiple resources on different attributes, you can specify multiple ignore rules:

```tf
#trivy:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr[from_port=3306]
#trivy:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr[from_port=5432]
```

You can also ignore a resource on multiple attributes in the same rule:
```tf
locals {
  rules = {
    first = {
      port = 1000
      type = "ingress"
    },
    second = {
      port = 1000
      type = "egress"
    }
  }
}

#trivy:ignore:aws-ec2-no-public-ingress-sgr[from_port=1000,type=egress]
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "example" {
  for_each = { for k, v in local.rules : k => v }

  type                     = each.value.type
  from_port                = each.value.port
  to_port                  = each.value.port
  protocol                 = "TCP"
  cidr_blocks              = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.example.id
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.example.id
}
```

Checks can also be ignored by nested attributes:

```tf
#trivy:ignore:*[logging_config.prefix=myprefix]
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "example" {
  logging_config {
    include_cookies = false
    bucket          = "mylogs.s3.amazonaws.com"
    prefix          = "myprefix"
  }
}
```

#### Ignoring module issues

Issues in third-party modules cannot be ignored using the method described above, because you may not have access to modify the module source code. In such a situation you can add ignore rules above the module block, for example:

```tf
#trivy:ignore:aws-s3-enable-logging
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"

  bucket = "my-s3-bucket"
}
```

An example of ignoring checks for a specific bucket in a module:
```tf
locals {
  bucket = ["test1", "test2"]
}

#trivy:ignore:*[bucket=test1]
module "s3_bucket" {
  for_each = toset(local.bucket)
  source   = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"
  bucket   = each.value
}
```

#### Support for Wildcards

You can use wildcards in the `ws` (workspace) and `ignore` sections of the ignore rules.

```tf
# trivy:ignore:aws-s3-*:ws:dev-*
```

This example ignores all checks starting with `aws-s3-` for workspaces matching the pattern `dev-*`.
