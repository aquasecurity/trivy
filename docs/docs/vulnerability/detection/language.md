# Language-specific Packages

`Trivy` automatically detects the following files in the container and scans vulnerabilities in the application dependencies.

The path of these files does not matter.

Example: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-ci-test/blob/main/Dockerfile)

[^1]: `*.egg-info`, `*.egg-info/PKG-INFO`, `*.egg` and `EGG-INFO/PKG-INFO`
[^2]: `.dist-info/META-DATA`
[^3]: `*.jar`, `*.war`, `*.par` and `*.ear`
[^4]: It requires Internet access
[^5]: It requires Internet access when the POM doesn't exist in your local repository
[^6]: UPX-compressed binaries don't work
[^7]: If smaller than go 1.17, go.sum is also required
[^8]: ✅ means "enabled" and `-` means "disabled" in the image scanning
[^9]: ✅ means "enabled" and `-` means "disabled" in the rootfs scanning
[^10]: ✅ means "enabled" and `-` means "disabled" in the filesystem scanning
[^11]: ✅ means "enabled" and `-` means "disabled" in the git repository scanning
[^12]: ✅ means that Trivy detects line numbers where each dependency is declared in the scanned file. Only supported in [json](../examples/report.md#json) and [sarif](../examples/report.md#sarif) formats. SARIF uses `startline == 1 and endline == 1` for unsupported file types
[^13]: To scan a filename other than the default filename use [file-patterns](../examples/others.md#file-patterns)
[^14]: When you scan `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml` together. See about it [here](../languages/rust.md#cargo).
