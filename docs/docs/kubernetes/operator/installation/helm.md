# Helm

[Helm], which is de facto standard package manager for Kubernetes, allows installing applications from parameterized
YAML manifests called Helm [charts].

To address shortcomings of [static YAML manifests](./kubectl.md) we provide the Helm chart to deploy the Trivy-Operator.
The Helm chart supports all [Install Modes](./../configuration.md#install-modes).

As an example, let's install the operator in the `trivy-system` namespace and configure it to select all namespaces,
except `kube-system` and `trivy-system`:

1. Clone the chart directory:
   ```
   git clone --depth 1 --branch {{ git.tag }} https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator.git
   cd trivy-operator
   ```
   Or add Aqua chart repository:
   ```
   helm repo add aqua https://aquasecurity.github.io/helm-charts/
   helm repo update
   ```
2. Install the chart from a local directory:
   ```
   helm install trivy-operator ./deploy/helm \
     --namespace trivy-system \
     --create-namespace \
     --set="trivy.ignoreUnfixed=true"
   ```
   Or install the chart from the Aqua chart repository:
   ```
   helm install trivy-operator aqua/trivy-operator \
     --namespace trivy-system \
     --create-namespace \
     --set="trivy.ignoreUnfixed=true" \
     --version {{ var.chart_version }}
   ```
   There are many [values] in the chart that can be set to configure Trivy-Operator.
3. Check that the `trivy-operator` Helm release is created in the `trivy-system` namespace, and it has status
   `deployed`:
   ```console
   $ helm list -n trivy-system
   NAME              	NAMESPACE         	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART                   	APP VERSION
   trivy-operator	trivy-system	1       	2021-01-27 20:09:53.158961 +0100 CET	deployed	trivy-operator-{{ var.chart_version }}	{{ git.tag[1:] }}
   ```
   To confirm that the operator is running, check that the `trivy-operator` Deployment in the `trivy-system`
   namespace is available and all its containers are ready:
   ```console
   $ kubectl get deployment -n trivy-system
   NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   trivy-operator   1/1     1            1           11m
   ```
   If for some reason it's not ready yet, check the logs of the Deployment for errors:
   ```
   kubectl logs deployment/trivy-operator -n trivy-system
   ```

## Uninstall

You can uninstall the operator with the following command:

```
helm uninstall trivy-operator -n trivy-system
```

You have to manually delete custom resource definitions created by the `helm install` command:

!!! danger
    Deleting custom resource definitions will also delete all security reports generated by the operator.

    ```
    kubectl delete crd vulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clustervulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd configauditreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd ciskubebenchreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd kubehunterreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clusterconfigauditreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clustercompliancereports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clustercompliancedetailreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    ```
