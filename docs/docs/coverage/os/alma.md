## Vulnerability
AlmaLinux offers its own security advisories, and these are utilized when scanning AlmaLinux for vulnerabilities.

### Data Source
See [here](../../scanner/vulnerability.md#data-sources).

### Fixed Version
When looking at fixed versions, it's crucial to consider the patches supplied by AlmaLinux.
For example, for CVE-2023-0464, the fixed version for AlmaLinux 9 is listed as `3.0.7-16.el9_2` in [their advisory][ALSA-2023:3722].
Note that this is different from the upstream fixed version, which is `3.0.9`, `3.1.1`, and son on.
Typically, only the upstream information gets listed on [NVD], so it's important not to get confused.

### Severity
Trivy calculates the severity of an issue based on the severity provided by AlmaLinux.
If the severity is not provided or defined yet by AlmaLinux, the severity from the NVD is taken into account.

Using CVE-2023-0464 as an example, while it is rated as "High" in NVD, AlmaLinux has marked as ["moderate"][ALSA-2023:3722].
As a result, Trivy will display it as "Medium".
