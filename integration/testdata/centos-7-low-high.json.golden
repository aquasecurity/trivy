        "FixedVersion": "219-67.el7",
        "Title": "systemd: kills privileged process if unprivileged PIDFile was tampered",
        "Description": "It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile files before using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an unprivileged user (e.g. User field set in the service file), a local attacker who is able to write to the PIDFile of the mentioned service may use this flaw to trick systemd into killing other services and/or privileged processes. Versions before v237 are vulnerable.",
