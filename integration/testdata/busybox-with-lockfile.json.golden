        "Description": "All versions of rust-openssl prior to 0.9.0 contained numerous insecure defaults\nincluding off-by-default certificate verification and no API to perform hostname\nverification.\n\nUnless configured correctly by a developer, these defaults could allow an attacker\nto perform man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe problem was addressed in newer versions by enabling certificate verification\nby default and exposing APIs to perform hostname verification. Use the\n`SslConnector` and `SslAcceptor` types to take advantage of these new features\n(as opposed to the lower-level `SslContext` type).\n",

Items may now be leaked if `Iterator::next` panics, but\nthey will not be dropped more than once.\n\nThank you to @Vurich for reporting this bug.\n",
